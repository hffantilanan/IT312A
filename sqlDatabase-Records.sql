'Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) -- NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said nations waging the war in Afghanistan must change their tactics and promote successes or risk losing public support there and at home. 
“Reaching our goal in Afghanistan is not guaranteed,” Rasmussen told an audience at the Atlantic Council policy group in Washington yesterday. More troops will be needed at least to train the Afghan National Security Forces, Rasmussen said, while cautioning that a revised strategy must be agreed upon before decisions are made about the additional resources.',

'The top commander in the war, U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal, recently submitted an assessment of the security situation in the country that recommends even more emphasis on protecting the population to make room for the countryâ€™s development. He concluded he would need more forces to carry out the strategy than the 68,000 the U.S. expects to have in Afghanistan by the end of the year. 

Leaders of the nations fighting in Afghanistan must speak out more about the successes achieved in the eight years of the war to win back public support, Rasmussen said.',

Fraud Allegations 

The election results remain in dispute because of fraud allegations. Rasmussen said he agreed that the NATO-led alliance needs a “credible and legitimate government in Afghanistan.” 

Some administration officials and members of Congress, who question whether the U.S. should step up its involvement as McChrystal recommends, cite the risk that the fraud allegations could erode the strength of the Afghan government.',
